    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
        We are a team of mental health professionals, researchers, and developers dedicated to providing accessible mental health assessments and resources. Our goal is to help individuals better understand their mental well-being through scientifically-backed self-assessments and to connect them to further support services when needed.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        Our mission is to make mental health resources available to everyone. By providing easy-to-use, online mental health tests, we aim to reduce the stigma around mental health and encourage individuals to seek help if they need it. We believe that early identification of mental health concerns can greatly improve the chances of effective treatment and recovery.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Why Mental Health Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Mental health affects every aspect of our lives, from our relationships to our ability to work and take care of ourselves. Unfortunately, many people struggle with mental health issues in silence, either due to lack of resources or fear of judgment. Our website seeks to break down those barriers by offering accessible tests that individuals can take in the comfort and privacy of their own homes.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">How We Help</h2>
    <p>
        Our platform offers a variety of tests designed to assess different aspects of mental health, including depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem, and more. Once you complete a test, we provide immediate feedback and guidance on what steps you can take next, whether that’s reaching out to a mental health professional or simply practicing self-care.
    </p>
